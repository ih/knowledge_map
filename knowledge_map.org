modification to Khan Academy code to allow for users to add content (knowledge map, excercises, videos)
* background
** DOM
the document object model
** jquery
a library for javascript
*** getting started with jQuery
http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery

** html
*** forms
http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
**** what does a html form consist of?
<form> </form> tags 
and <input type .. />
tags

usually ends with a submit input type
***** what does the <input type ... /> tag consist of?

** Django
*** template system
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/
**** what is the purpose of the django template system?
it provides tags for dynamically rendering html pages
**** templates
***** what is a template?
it is a text document that gives the general form for some text and allows for variance using variables and tags
****** what are tags?
special syntax for controlling the logic of the template, they are like functions/operations in a programming language 
**** variables
***** what is the syntax for variables in a template?
{{variable}}
***** what does the template engine do when it encounters a variable?
it evaluates the expression in the braces {{}} and inserts the value into the template
***** what is prohibited in the name of the variable?
punctuation and spaces
***** what happens when a dot is encountered in a variable name?
the following are attempted (in order)
dictionary lookup -> attribute lookup -> method call -> list-index lookup
***** what happens if you use a variable that doesn't exist?
the value of TEMPLATE_STRING_IF_INVALID is returned which is the empty string by default
**** filters
***** what are filters?
the are functions that get applied to template variables after they are evaluated and before they are rendered
***** what are filters for?
usually modifying the appearance of the template variables
***** how do you apply filters?
use the | character
{{variable|filter}}
***** how do you apply multiple filters?
{{variable|filter1|filter2...}}
application of filters is left to right
***** how do you pass an argument to a filter?
with a :
{{variable|filter:argument}}
***** what does the default filter do?
it assigns a default value (an argument to the filter) to a variable if the variable evaluates to false or ''
***** how do you get the lenght of a template variable?
{{variable|length}}
***** how do you remove html from a template variable?
use the striptags filter e.g. {{variable|striptags}}
**** tags
***** what is the syntax for tags?
{% tag [arguments] %}
***** what is the syntax for tags that require a beginning and end?
{% [tag name] %} template contents {% end[tag name] %}
***** what is the syntax for the for tag?
{% for item in some_list %}
template content possible containing variable for {{item}}
{% endfor %}
****** what does the for tag do?
it goes through each element of the list and inserts the loop contents into the document after each iteration
***** what is the syntax for the if and else tags?
{% if boolean variable/expression %}
{% else %}
{% endif %}

**** comments
***** how do you comment part of a single line?
{# #}
***** how do you comment multiple lines?
anything between the tags
{% comment %}
{% endcomment %}
is ignored
**** template inheritance
***** what does template inheritance do?
it makes it easy to create new documents with the same overall form but with parts of it changed
***** how do you mark a section of a template that can be modified by child templates?
use a block tag
***** what is the syntax for a block tag?
{% block [block_name] %} {% endblock [block_name] %} different blocks must have different names
****** what does the block tag do?
it marks part of a template that can be changed by child templates
***** what is the syntax for the extends tag?
{% extends "[parent template name]" %} it must be the first tag used in the template
****** what does the extends tag do?
it makes the template a child of some other template
***** how do you create a child template?
start with the extends tag and then define contents for blocks that you want to change in the parent template using {% block [block_name] %} {% endblock [blockname] %} where block_name is a block in the parent.  you can also add new blocks if this child will be a parent for some other template
***** what is a common way to use templates?
create a base.html template that captures the style of your website and has blocks for different sections to base.html 

create a section template for each section with styling/format for that section

create individual children templates of the sections that correspond to actual contents for that section

***** where must the extends tag go?
at the beginning of the file
***** what should you do if you find yourself using a lot of duplication among templates?
create a parent template and have the pages with duplication inherit from it
***** how do you get the content of a block from a parent template?
{{ block.super }}
****** why would you want to use the block.super tag?
if you want to append content to the block of the parent template instead of overwriting it
***** can different block tags have the same name?
no

* features
** allow a user to create and modify knowledge maps
*** how does the current knowledge map work?
**** where is the code located?
In the frontend, the map is reached by clicking on the practice tab.  The practice tab page's html is in viewexercises.html in the root directory

viewexcercises.html is a template and the corresponding handler exists in main.py and is called ViewAllExcercises

The map seems to be created in this section
    <div id="dashboard-map">
        {% knowledgemap_embed exercises map_coords %}
    </div>
these are template values defined in the ViewAllExercises handler class

viewexcercises.html is a template and the corresponding handler exists in main.py and is called ViewAllExcercises 
***** understand app engine/django markup 
****** DONE run server locally
https://sites.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/forge/for-developers/getting-started-with-the-code

from the google app engine directory run the command
dev_appserver.py [khan directory]
******* DONE go through startup guide
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/

**** how does the excercise code work?
***** try to solve open issue 

**** how does the knoweldge map code work?
***** viewknowledgemap.html
this file loads the javacript infovis toolkit (http://thejit.org/) which probably creates the graph
*** ui
the general idea is to allow users to easily add nodes to the knowledge map and indicate the relationships of the new node to other nodes
**** adding a node
***** right click to bring up add option
the user will right-click on the map which will bring up a context-sensitive menu to add a node
(or perhaps one can hover over a node and this will bring up a menu to add children?)
****** how do clicks work?
******* look at jit demo, look at code for clicking on knowledge map node 
******* right click tutorial
jquery http://www.webdeveloperjuice.com/2010/02/22/create-simple-jquery-right-click-cross-browser-vertical-menu/

http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/09/jquery-context-menu-plugin/#demo
***** node info form
if selected this menu should load a form for giving information on the node (an excercise)
***** node info submission
submitting the node info form should create an exercise entity and the map should display the new entity
**** adding an edge
*** backend
**** node
what does a node correspond to?
**** link
** automatic clustering of questions
** allow a user to add excercises
*** unanswered questions
allow user to create questions that don't have answers and have visual appearance of the node in the map indicate this
** interactive answering for flashcards
when entering answer for a flashcard have a text region where they can type then compare what is typed to the true answer
** allow abstraction over a set of nodes
allow excercises to be grouped together

when excercises get grouped then two hidden nodes will be created one at the top where all nodes that are prerequisites of any node in the group will connect to and any node in the group will connect to it as a prerequisite 

and one at the bottom which will have as a prerequisite every node in the group and any node that has a member of the group as a prerequisite will have this bottom node as a prerequisite 



** have color of node be a function of last reviewed (or need for review)
** have a different type of node called problem which highlights a set of knowledge nodes that are needed to solve it
* ka code
** try and log in as admin
* prototype
** DONE create the basic appengine backend to go to the map page
have a single knowledgemap page that displays the knowledge map
** use jit to make a simple interface to the exercise backend
use a modified spacetree like in khan academy
*** DONE how does khan academy put the space tree into the exercise map?
**** viewknowledgemap.html
this html file contains the script that draws the st map
***** code for dealing with ie
***** rectangleWithOtherParents
a node type that draws additional edges from a node to its other parents
used b/c space tree nodes only have single parents

***** translation of excercises into json data format
starts at build the graph from the hidden excercise table
this is used to by the JIT space tree 
**** have knowledgemap.html display a dag
the khan space tree using rectangleWithOtherParents node
***** get regular spacetree to display
minimal required things are injectInto, call to loadJSON, call to compute, call to onClick the root
****** write html based on jit page demo
view-source:http://thejit.org/static/v20/Jit/Examples/Spacetree/example3.html
******* DONE how does khan/app engine include javascript into an html file?
modify app.yaml to have a handler for static files
******* DONE why is css needed for the spacetree to display?
******** DONE only base.css needed why?
it seems to be because the infovis div needs to have an area specified (perhaps b/c this defines the canvas size)?
****** add spacetree javascript
******* DONE example3.js
******** first block
an anonymous function that is used to set the global variables labelType, useGradients, nativeTextSupport, and animate 
these variables are for ie and ipad
******** declaration of Log
this is the object literal way of defining a prototype(think class) in javascript

it creates a Log object that has a method for printing some text to the screen in a certain location (as specified by its dom id)

******** init
creates the data in the json variable, the jit space tree uses data in this format to construct the tree/graph

creates an instance of a $jit spacetree 
********* spacetree constructor
seems to take a json formatted object, which has initial parameters for the space tree like 'injectInto'

********* spacetree functions
once the spacetree instance is created certain functions are called for the instance such as loadJSON, compute, and onclick
******* DONE knowledge_map.js
******* DONE change orientation
******* add google maps zoom?
***** turn regular spacetree into dag
****** add khan code

*** DONE add rectangleWithOthers to knowledge_map.js
**** DONE what is the format for otherParents
a list of node ids
*** be able to create a node and connect to other nodes
**** create a node
***** DONE how should a new node be created?
click on the empty part of the map 
this drops down a menu at the top of the screen for creating a new node

have a button "organize" which does the renders the spacetree layout, this will allow the user to place nodes roughly where they want as they begin to figure out how it relates to other nodes and once the structure is determined one can get a cleaner layout quickly
****** possibilities
******* click on empty part of map 
this one
******* click on node 
******* drag from empty to node
******* button for creating a node in prominent location on the map

***** DONE right click menu
right clicking on the map records the position of the click for drawing an added node to
****** DONE jquery context menu plugin
http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/09/jquery-context-menu-plugin/
in order to get the menu to properly display in the right place have the css position be set to fixed
*******  jquery basics
javascript library
******** DONE installation 
http://www.jquerytutorialsforbeginners.com/installing-and-using-jquery/
******** DONE event handlers
jquerytutorialsforbeginners event handlers
******** plugins
********* installation
place the folder for the plugin into the javascript source
include the script it in the html after including the jquery source
***** drop-down form
****** fields for label and parents
******* DONE how does autosuggest capture input?
you can get it by calling serialzeArray on the form element inside a jquery submit event, data is stored in as_values_[name set in autosuggest options]
******** change autosuggest to only apply to the parents/children field?
****** parse the form data 
***** modify json graph data
****** DONE initially make child of root
******* DONE change function in contextMenu
******* DONE redraw the graph?
use refresh function for now

***** CANCELED add parents
****** initially add parents after node is created
******* DONE make labels/names visible
******* DONE create 'add parent' in context-menu
******** DONE create a context menu for nodes
********* DONE possible approaches
********** DONE jquery context menu plugin
probably can't directly use jquery contextMenu plugin, because nodes aren't really html elements

use regular expression to get node div ids 
create a context menu using the selector for node divs
*********** DONE can you have nested context menus?
if div B is inside div A, can div B have a different context menu?

yes, the contextMenu for the inner div is defined just like that of the outer
*********** CANCELED what is the format for a node selector?
nodes are probably not HTML elements and so don't have selectors
but it looks like you can use the label object in onCreateLabel as a jquery selector
*********** CANCELED look into using the current google maps version of the knowledge map
*********** DONE onCreateLabel approach
interactions with nodes are usually dealt with by adding event handlers and styles to node
************ DONE how what kind of information is passed to an event handler called in onCreateLabel
the label object can be used as a jquery selector
************ CANCELED use dynamic css to do the menu
we can have html code for the menu and use javascript to dynamically set the display and position properties in a mouseover or oncontextmenu event
******* DONE have form for parents appear for add parent option
when the option to add parents is selected a form should appear allowing the user to type in parents for the current node

for now have the input appear at the top of the page
******** DONE approaches
going with form appearing at the top of the page
********* form/inputs appear at the top of the page
********* form inside context menu option
use jquery to replace the add parents option in the contextmenu with a form for adding parent names

see http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Live_Examples_of_jQuery
animate a paragraph slide in/out example
********* jquery and forms?
********** use .addClass like the snippet on the jquery front page
********* form inside a node
use javascript and css to blow up a node and create a form inside of it?

******** DONE add html for the input in knowledgeMap.html
for now have forms for content creation appear at the top of the page
********* CANCELED jquery ui autocomplete
jquery ui lacks support for multiple input
instead try http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin
http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#default
********** DONE install jquery ui
********** CANCELED copy autocomplete example to add 'add parent' input/form
********* autosuggest
http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin
********** DONE get it running
********** make code nice
*********** DONE have knowledge_map.js load in jquery document.ready style
*********** split javascript into different files
************ how can they all get access to json (the node data)?
one possibility is to structure things server side and pass node data as template values 
******** DONE make the form hidden initially
******** DONE jquery for visibility
have the action of the form option be a slidedown call for the form
use .show()
******* form submit action
have submission of the form add parents to appropriate node then make the form disappear
see rateme example in http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
******** have form submission action change json variable
********* DONE how do you know what node to add parents to?
node.id from node passed to onCreateLabel
********** DONE seems like el passed to action function of contextMenu should have the info...how do you get it out?
node.id
********* contextMenu function in onCreateLabel 
have the action taken call a function that waits until the form has been submitted, pass in node.id where node is the one getting new parents

once the form has been submitted there should be hidden field of the input that has the new parents

take those parents and modify the json tree 

make a call to addSubTree with the modified json tree
******** have knowledgeMap refresh or addSubtree
******** do a slideup call for the form or make the menu disappear
**** edit a node
***** context-menu
***** drop-down form
**** CANCELED organizing map
a button that will render the nodes according to the spacetree format
** implement the models and control for the map using appengine
*** node creation form
** make pretty
*** external 
jquery ui theme roller
*** internal
**** TODO make html more modular
***** CANCELED main.py
use djange template inheritance instead to make things more modular

make the html more modular by rendering individual parts of the page and sticking them together in the get() function of the RequestHandler
****** how do you model nested elements?
you can pass rendered subparts as template values

***** template inheritance
* examples
** decompose a traditional document into a knowledge map 
take a traditional linearly structured document and rewrite it in a graph structure then compare it side-by-side

the cplusplus.com tutorial would be a good example

compare to wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
